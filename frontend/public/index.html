                <p>
                  To begin with, I would like to tell you that I tested out Ghost recently. And I like it so much that I moved my blog from Jekyll to Ghost. I decided to start afresh, so there isn't much on the blog, but yes, my website <a href="https://navrajun.com">navarjun.com</a> is on Ghost now.
                </p>

                <h2>Why am I interested in working at Ghost?</h2>

                <p>
                  I have known about Ghost since 2016. At the time I was not so familiar with the javascript-on-the-server world, but soon enough I learned about it. I believe it has transferred immense power to the new developers by using just one language everywhere. Teaching someone end-to-end about web technologies, which I have done a lot, has become easier.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But this letter isn't about javascript, but about Ghost. The open source nature of the software is what has made Wordpress immensely impactful, and I believe open source software is a step towards democratizing software. Although there is definitely a place for business secrets, but the closed nature of software companies have alienated the masses. As a mechanic, one can repair, modify, personalize cars as they please, while others can consult a mechanic who is not affiliated with the manufacturer in any way. Analogously, open-source software is a custom-made ecosystem for software.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sure, every developer can build a full-featured CMS, or a physics engine, or a gaming engine, or an AR/VR experience. I would be lying if I say I have not built them ever. Most recently, I built a CMS ground-up for <a href="https://artofthemarch.boston">artofthemarch.boston</a>. These are good things to dabble with but if someone can provide a foundation and take care of the little details; that offloads the work (which can take a lifetime) and frees-up time to do more and build something more aligned with one's interests on that foundation.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Another reason I would like to work at Ghost is the understanding of data-ownership. Medium has definitely made it easy for people to write, but the platform is the beneficiary. The centralization of data-ownership has lead to imbalance of power among people. I appreciate how Ghost has made this statement by going even as far to register as a non-profit. That speaks loudly to me. By doing that, Ghost has shown that it is possible to build software for good, without profit motive. Unlike platforms that make all decisions based on how to make a <em>user</em> spend more time on there. (Also, I can't overestimate my appreciation of Ghost using the word <em>customers</em> over <em>users</em>)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Lastly, to bring back the above quote… The intentions of the decisions made within a company does make a huge difference in the direction it will go. Ghost, not only says, but has also demonstrated their mission-driven approach.
                </p>

                <h2>Why am I the right candidate?</h2>

                <p>
                  I am a design technologist based in Vancouver, Canada. I have 6 years of experience as an engineer and 3 years as a designer. I likes to work in an environment/on projects that challenge him. I have earned a masters in information design and data visualizations, while working with data visualizations for about 2 years. I have lived and worked in multiple cities around the world including Delhi, Bangalore, Boston, and Vancouver.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I am naturally a curious and self-motivated person. Self-motivation is likely a filter that Ghost has already tested using this exercise. It was my curiosity that pushed me to try out Ghost before actually applying for a role in the company. My curiosity comes along with humility which I believe is absolutely necessary to learn from others.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My knowledge about programming and design enables me to think about the product in a broader way that bridges both. My teaching experience has helped me to improve my communication and articulation of my thoughts immensely. The teaching experience also enabled me to articulate the same concepts in multiple manners based on the students and their previous experiences. (I was teaching programming to design undergraduates)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ghost is doing great work in publishing sphere. I would like to be a part of the team behind a mission driven product, especially when the mission aligns with my beliefs.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Looking forward to talking to amazing people from Ghost!
                </p>

                            Jeepers now that's a huge release with some big community earnings to back it - it must be so rewarding seeing creators quit their day jobs after monetizing (with real MRR) on the new platform.

                            Switched our blog from Hubspot to Ghost a year ago -- turned out to be a great decision. Looking forward to this update....the in-platform analytics look especially delicious. :)

                                        Thanks Sophie! Last year has been an absolute goldrush for the creator economy. Slowly at first, then all at once. Will be interesting to see how this ecosystem evolves over the next few years.
